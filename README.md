# Comparing-Baltimore-North-Boston-Area-household-income

When comparing two different geographic areas, I choose where I grew up in North Boston. The approximate population sizes are close enough (~600,000) and they are both port cities. The similarities end there, as North Boston has much more diverse racial and ethnic groups than Baltimore and the income is higher. When evaluating the data, a system was placed to find and evaluate primarily white non-hispanic population in the data sets. This was done to detect and catagorize the "White L" of Baltimore and any similar distribution in North Boston.

Data sets were downloaded, then combined together into one master copy
Vlookup was used to find and connect all the data together via tractID
A logic test was used to sum minority incomes, and check if altas did not find enough data points (~4,000) to give a value.
Areas segregated by State, using Name ID.
Pivot Table was formed from data.

Data retrieved from: https://www.opportunityatlas.org/
Excel Sheet where the data is primarily analyzed: https://github.com/Gramir10/Comparing-Baltimore-North-Boston-Area-household-income/blob/master/Ramirez_Miniproject_1.xlsx

One sample graph generated from the data analysis, includes data from all the Household Income Data from North Boston. Stratified by race and ethnicity.
