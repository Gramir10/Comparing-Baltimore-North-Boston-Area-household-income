# Comparing-Baltimore-North-Boston-Area-household-income

When comparing two different geographic areas, I choose where I grew up in North Boston. The approximate population sizes are close enough (~600,000) and they are both port cities. The similarities end there, as North Boston has much more diverse racial and ethnic groups than Baltimore and the income is higher. When evaluating the data, a system was placed to find and evaluate primarily white non-hispanic population in the data sets. This was done to detect and catagorize the "White L" of Baltimore and any similar distribution in North Boston.

One sample graph generated from the data analysis, includes data from all the Household Income Data from North Boston. Stratified by race and ethnicity.
